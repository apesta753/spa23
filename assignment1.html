<h1>Oh hey, I'm Ailyn!</h1>
<p>I'm Ailyn. I was born in Caracas, Venezuela but moved to Massachusetts 22 years ago. We just bought a house in Weymouth, MA!</p>
<p>I am working toward my masters in Digital Media. I have taken a few classes about web development. I would say I'm proficient at HTML and CSS, 
and beginner at Javascript and PHP. I have a pretty good sense of the basics, but I still have a lot to learn.</p>

<h3>Ailyn's Favorites</h3>
<p>Restaurant: <a href="http://townspapizza.com/menu/" target="#">Town Spa Pizza</a> – best south shore bar pizza!<br>
Place: The beach! Any beach, but extra points if it’s dog-friendly and I can bring my Chocolate Lab, Maggie.
